# Challenge 3 - That's testy
We're cool, we're hip. We did our first React/Redux app. 
It's called "conduit". It's cute.

You can sign up, you can sign in. 
Users have a profile with their contributions listed and their favorite articles. 
You can read a contributor's article and favorite them (and so onâ€¦).

But something is missing. 
We can feel it. 
It's as if we had nothing to guarantee the quality of our releases. 
It's a sense of unease that grows with our code's complexity.

Take this application, and please, please choose the best tool and the best framework to ensure we can guarantee a 
consistent, seamlessly high-quality application for our users. 
Be wary: our designer likes to change things A LOT. 
So we need to be able to maintain both the feature and the look, and in a continuously automated fashion, please!
