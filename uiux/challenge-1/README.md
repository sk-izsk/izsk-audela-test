# Challenge 1 - Karaoke needs words
It's your birthday (come on, just pretend!) and you're organizing a party with all your friends. 
You've decided that people shall be singing. 
Now, being the developer that you are, you won't use some cranky old book with songs to get the lyrics, you want a web 
app! Not only an app, but a beautiful Single Web Page app that you can be proud of.

It so happens that the MusixMatch API (https://developer.musixmatch.com/documentation) has all the data you need.

Now, it just needs an artist search bar, list of songs, ability to sort the songs by the number of lyrics they have, 
title, and duration. You will want, of course, to be able to display the song lyrics themselves. 

A nice bonus would be to minimize the number of calls you're doing to the MusixMatch API, because we don't want to 
bother them while singing drunk...
